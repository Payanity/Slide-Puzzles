# Slide-Puzzles
Used Unity and C# to create virtual slide puzzle games for my friend's birthday and for children 
I taught at camp. Play my friend's birthday slide puzzle at https://payanity.itch.io/happy-birthday-hanklin 
(content warning: explicit music).

Removed Library, Temp, Logs, and Object folders due to size, but the removal of these shouldn't affect the project build.
